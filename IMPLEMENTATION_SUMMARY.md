### Projects Created
1. **AppointmentService**: ASP.NET Core Web API with Minimal APIs
2. **NotificationService**: ASP.NET Core Web API for handling notifications
3. **ApiGateway**: ASP.NET Core Web API for routing and cross-cutting concerns
4. **BlazorApp**: Blazor WebAssembly frontend application
5. **Models**: Shared class library for common models

### Configuration Files
- ✅ Launch settings for all services (consistent port mapping)
- ✅ Dockerfiles for all services
- ✅ Updated docker-compose.yml
- ✅ Solution file with all projects referenced

## Current Capabilities

### Development
- All services can be built and run independently
- Consistent port configuration:
  - Appointment Service: 8080
  - Notification Service: 8081
  - API Gateway: 8000
  - Blazor Frontend: 8082
- Projects organized following microservices principles

### Containerization
- Dockerfiles for all services
- Multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose
- Proper service dependencies configured

## What's Left to Implement

### Core Functionality
1. **Appointment Service**:
   - Complete CRUD operations implementation
   - Data persistence with PostgreSQL
   - Validation and error handling
   - Swagger documentation

2. **Event-Driven Communication**:
   - RabbitMQ integration
   - Event publishing from Appointment Service
   - Event consuming in Notification Service
   - Event models definition

3. **API Gateway**:
   - Request routing configuration
   - Cross-cutting concerns implementation
   - API documentation aggregation

4. **Notification Service**:
   - Notification channel implementation
   - Business logic for different notification types
   - Notification management features

5. **Blazor Frontend**:
   - Appointment management UI
   - Real-time updates
   - Authentication and authorization

### Quality and Production Readiness
1. **Testing**:
   - Unit tests for all services
   - Integration tests
   - End-to-end UI tests

2. **Security**:
   - Authentication implementation
   - Authorization policies
   - Input validation and sanitization

3. **Observability**:
   - Logging implementation
   - Health checks
   - Metrics and monitoring

4. **Performance**:
   - Caching strategies
   - Database optimization
   - Network optimization
